# Vehicle Registration Number Recognition 🚙

A simple web application to detect the registration number of the vehicle from the uploaded image. The application uses the OpenALPR library to identify the registration number. Users can go to the application, upload any vehicle's image and get the registration number. Currently, the application can detect only US-based vehicle registration numbers. Support for other countries will be added to the application in the near future.

## What is ALPR? 🤔
[OpenALPR](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr) is an open-source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written in C++ with bindings in C#, Java, Node.js, Go, and Python. The library analyzes images and video streams to identify license plates. The output is the text representation of any license plate characters.

## How to install ALPR? 🤔
**For Ubuntu:** Follow the steps mentioned [here](https://gist.github.com/braitsch/ee5434f91744026abb6c099f98e67613) to install the necessary packages and libraries required in order for ALPR to function smoothly

After doing that, go to `/openalpr/src/bindings/python` and run `python setup.py build` followed by `sudo python setup.py install`
This will install the OpenALPR library onto your system.

## Project Setup 🛠
**Note**: Make sure you have Python version 3.8+ and Postgres 14 or above
